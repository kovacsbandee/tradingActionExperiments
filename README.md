In this repo the tradingBot repo is revised, the aim here is to test various watchlists and strategies on loads of equities and choose the appropriet trading actions based on the nature of each portfolio element.
The general strategy is the following: we stay in each position until 1% of gain is reached, and the stop loss is 0.5% in every case!
For strategies trend scalping and MACD are the first candidates.
